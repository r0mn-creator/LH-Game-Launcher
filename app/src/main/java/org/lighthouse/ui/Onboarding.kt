/**
 * First-run setup.
 *
 * A fresh install otherwise lands on a shelf reading "folder source has no
 * roots" with a Choose folder button - technically honest, and a terrible first
 * thing to see.
 *
 * Deliberately asks for ONE emulator and ONE folder. Setting up twelve systems
 * before you have seen a single game is a chore, and the launcher is useful the
 * moment one system works; everything else is a Settings screen away. Every
 * step therefore carries both **Next** and **Done**, and Done finishes setup
 * immediately from wherever you are.
 *
 * Each step is a [MenuNode], so the wizard renders through the same row
 * vocabulary as Settings and inherits pad navigation, touch, and the hints that
 * name the action - rather than being a second UI to keep in step.
